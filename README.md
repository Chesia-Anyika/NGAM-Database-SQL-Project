# National Gender Affirmative Monitoring Database (NGAM)

The **National Gender Affirmative Monitoring Database (NGAM)** is a prototype system designed to track gender equity in education and employment. Built using **Oracle 18c**, this relational database systematically collects and analyzes data on **student enrollment, graduation rates, employment trends, salary disparities, and hiring patterns**. 

### Key Features:
- **Structured Data Management**: Developed with SQL queries and normalized to **Third Normal Form (3NF)** to ensure data integrity.
- **Data Visualization**: Entity-Relationship Diagrams (ERD) created with Draw.io for clear schema representation.
- **Gender Analytics**: Reports on **gender representation, salary gaps, and employment trends** to assess the impact of gender-affirmative policies.
- **Future Scalability**: Can be expanded with AI-driven analytics for enhanced policy recommendations.

### Technologies Used:
- **Database**: Programiz SQL Compiler
- **Query Language**: SQL
- **Modeling Tools**: Draw.io (diagrams.net)

This project supports **evidence-based decision-making** to bridge gender disparities in education and employment. Future enhancements may integrate **AI-powered analytics** for more precise monitoring.
